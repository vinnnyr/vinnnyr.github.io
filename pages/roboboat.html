          <h2>Georgia Tech Roboboat Team </h2>
          <p class="text-left">
            As part of the Georgia Tech RoboBoat Team part of the Aerospace Systems and Design Laboratory (ASDL) at Georgia Tech, I have been leading the effort since 2017 to design build and test new iterations of our robotic, autonomous boat for the AUVSI/RoboNation
            Roboboat competition.
            <br> The main motivation behind the design of this vehicle is ensuring the team has a reliable hardware platform so that we can properly demonstrate the capabilities of the autonomy software.
            <br><br> While in the past we reused an older hardware platform, in 2017 I led the effort to build a brand new boat named <a href="https://whyyesteam.wordpress.com/vehicles/richgirl/"> "Rich Girl" </a>.
            <br> Design considerations included:
            <ul class="text-left">
              <li>maximizing size of the vehicle to have a large deck size for UAV landing </li>
              <li>adding a larger capacity battery, allowing for minimization of two major time sinks:
                <ul class="text-left">
                  <li>charging the battery </li>
                  <li>moving the boat in and out of the water </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li> improving speed and turning speed of the vehicle </li>
              <li> modularity -- perhaps the most important aspect of all.
                <ul class="text-left">
                  <li>this ensures that our efforts result in a hardware platform that can be used for years to come, with minimal major hardware changes</li>
                  <li> The modularity of the vehicle allowed us to pursue a new, lighter pontoon design for the 2018 vehicle</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

                2017 Technical Design Report </a> hosted on the RoboNation website.
              The team is currently working towards bringing a 2018 vehicle to competition. You can view updates for our 2018 vehicle <a href="https://whyyesteam.wordpress.com/news/"> here. </a>
              I will update this page when the vehicle is finalized, however, we know that we are bringing new fiberglass foam core pontoons, as well as a cooling system for the boat's computers.
